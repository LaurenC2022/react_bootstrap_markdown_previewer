## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Bootstrap
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

Passing state in react to sibling components. React passes data from parent to child. Components should be stand alone and reusable. To use react in this way, I used the following code and pass pieces of state in a way that all the components are reusable.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```jsx
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

to do's

- make site more like the sample, with window resizing/ make views expand and collapse
- remove default textarea resizing option on botton right

- add renderers function and pass as atribute to Markdown. This will fix img overflow problem in markdown:

  - https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown/issues/174
  - https://jacobwicks.github.io/2020/06/19/rendering-markdown-and-resizing-images-with-react-markdown.html

- make better readme page

- Previewer should have a minHeight and vary in height depending on the lenght of the input text. Resizing featured mentioned above should cause scroll with overflow-auto when preview is made smaller by user

- change the image of matrix background to moving
- get .md from gitHub static file

- upload app to the internet
- submit to fcc
- add to website

- maximize learning through reading the docs for react, vite, javascript, css, bootstrap, and etc., writing documentation/ commenting code for this project, and writing blog posts

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
